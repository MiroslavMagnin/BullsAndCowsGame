My realisation of the "Bulls and cows" game. The simple JavaFX application, which become my first serious program on Java (specifically JavaFX).

Stack of technologies: JavaFX, FXML and CSS, XML (for saving settings)

Creation time: two weeks. It took long because I really knew a few about JavaFX, also I spent a lot of time for searching the solve problems with the styles.
